            The <strong>Longest Non-Repeating Substring</strong> problem asks
            you to find the longest substring within a string that contains no
            repeated characters. This is a classic challenge that demonstrates
            how to efficiently analyze sequences without redundant checks.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            The <strong>Sliding Window</strong> technique is an effective way to
            solve such problems. Instead of checking every possible substring
            (which can be very slow), a sliding window uses two pointers to
            represent a range within the string, expanding and shrinking
            dynamically to maintain the desired property, in this case, no
            repeated characters.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            In the upcoming logic challenge, youâ€™ll control a sliding window
            over a target string to find non-repeating substrings. Your
            goal is to keep moving the end pointer forward, cutting substrings
            along the way, until you reach the end of the string. This hands-on
            experience will help you grasp the sliding window technique and the
            logic behind finding the longest substring without repeated
            characters.

              Keep track of the current window and the longest string you have
              seen so far.
